# Introduction to Operating Systems

The primary way the OS does this is through a general technique that we call virtualization. That is, the OS takes a physical resource (such as the processor, or memory, or a disk) and transforms it into a more general, powerful, and easy-to-use virtual form of itself. Thus, we sometimes refer to the operating system as a virtual machine.
