# The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference
## The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
### Why Small Habits Make a Big Difference

It is so easy to overetimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than your current results. Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.

### What Progress is Really like

Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.

> When nothing seems to help, I go and lokk at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split intwo, and I know it was not that last blow that did it-but all that had done before.

### Forget about Goals, Focus on Systems instead

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

### Summary
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.
- Habits are double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compunding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.
- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
- You do not rise to the level of youor goals. You fall to the le**vel of your systems.
