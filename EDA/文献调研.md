# [TCAD 2019] X-CGRA An energy-efficient approximate coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture

## Abstract

- an energy-efficient approximate CGRA (X-CGRA)
configurable approximate adders and multipliers in the so-called quality-scalable processing elements  (QSPEs); other components modified
- a mappping technique to utilize the QSPEs
## Intro
CGRA enables improvement in performance and energy efficiency. CGRA is usually composed of a main processor, a context memory, a data memory, and
an array of processing elements (PEs)
Approximate computing is an emerging paradigm that trades off output quality/accuracy for performance, area, power, and energy efficiency in error-resilient applications

### A target research problem and motivational analysis
Having the ability to dynamically configure the accuracy enables the concept of providing different QoS and energy levels on the same hardware platform.
Utilizing quality-scalable arithmetic units that support both exact and approximate operations with fine-grained power-gating would provide the efficienc improvement with lower overhead.
### B contributions
- Leveraging approximate computing paradigm for CGRAs
- A dynamic run-time quality-configurable X-CGRA
- a method selecting those nodes of a given data flow graph (DFG) implemented on the X-CGRA
